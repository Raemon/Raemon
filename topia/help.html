 <p>Topia is cute, but a work in progress. Sometimes buggy.</p>
 <p>If you experience lag, try zooming in (using Cmd "+") to focus your screen on fewer objects. This tends to smooth experience.</p>
 <p>If you have significant difficulties of any kind, try refreshing.</p>
  <p>NOTE: <em>You can click to move</em>, which is often smoother than using the arrow keys. If you want to move a long distance, you can zoom out (using Cmd "-"), and then click far away, and you'll walk there smoothly.</p>
 <p><b>Known Bugs</b><p>
 <ul>
  <li>The first time (or two?) you use a portal-button to teleport to a new area, it may freeze. This seems to go away after the first time, and subsequent portals work properly. (You can try portaling into the Tent by clicking on its entrace).</li>
  <li>On Firefox, it'll briefly load all sound files on the map and play them for a couple seconds, but this tends to sort itself out quickly and then sounds will work properly.</li>
  <li>If you are not an admin, the Zoom In buttons don't work. Also, those buttons don't zoom the map, but instead zoom the size of the videos. Sorry!</li>
