      <h3>Welcome to Ray's Topia Birthday!</h3>
    <p>Topia is an adorable videochat app where you walk around and talk to people near you. It works fine on most computers but some people experience lag when too many people gather together. So, the world is deliberately big. You're encouraged to explore the world, and meet people along the way.</p>
    <p><b>Before you start:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Disable adblock</em> (unfortunately it adblock started blocking Topia recently)</li>
      <li>Make sure to enter a screenname before logging in (so other people can tell who you are)</li>
      <li>Wear headphones to reduce background noise.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you have any problems, I recommend:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Turning it off and on again (i.e. restart chrome)</li>
      <li>Close other tabs / apps</li>
      <li>Try Incognito window (sometimes browser extensions interfere)</li>
      <li>Message Ray on Facebook if you're still having problems</li>
    </ul>
    <p><button onClick="randomIntro()">I've disabled Adblock and have headphones. Let's Go!</button></p>
